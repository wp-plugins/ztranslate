Adds userfriendly multilingual content management and translation support into Wordpress. It is fork of qTranslate.

== Description ==


Writing multilingual content is already hard enough, why make using a plugin even more complicated? I created zTranslate to let Wordpress have an easy to use interface for managing a fully multilingual web site.

zTranslate makes creation of multilingual content as easy as working with a single language. Here are some features:

- One-Click-Switching between the languages - Change the language as easy as switching between Visual and HTML
- Language customizations without changing the .mo files - Use Quick-Tags instead for easy localization
- Multilingual dates out of the box - Translates dates and time for you
- Comes with a lot of languages already builtin! - English, German, Simplified Chinese and a lot of others
- No more juggling with .mo-files! - zTranslate will download them automatically for you
- Choose one of 3 Modes to make your URLs pretty and SEO-friendly. - The everywhere compatible `?lang=en`, simple and beautiful `/en/foo/` or nice and neat `en.yoursite.com`
- One language for each URL - Users and SEO will thank you for not mixing multilingual content

zTranslate supports infinite languages, which can be easily added/modified/deleted via the comfortable Configuration Page.
All you need to do is activate the plugin and start writing the content!

== Installation ==

Installation of this plugin is fairly easy:

1. Download the plugin from [here](http://wordpress.org/plugins/ztranslate/ "zTranslate").
1. Extract all the files. 
1. Upload everything (keeping the directory structure) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. There should be a `/wp-content/plugins/ztranslate` directory now with `ztranslate.php` in it.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Add the zTranslate Widget to let your visitors switch the language.
